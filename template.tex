    \begin{twenty}
      \twentyitem
        {2021 - now}
        {Bachelor of Computer Science}
        {Wrocław University of Science and Technology}
        {My studies emphasize understanding IT.
Throughout them, I have gained knowledge
about algorithms, floating point errors,
computation limits, and compilers.}

    \section{Projects}
    
    \begin{twentymid} % Environment for a list with descriptions  
        \twentymiditem{2D Game}{
            My two friends and I have made a 2D game in      \textbf{C++} without using any game engines, relying only on \textbf{SFML} for window rendering. We created everything from collision detection to the user interface ourselves. If you're interested, you can check out the \textbf{devlog} I created to see our creative process and some of the systems we developed. \colorhrefcustom{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZTlXNqfFJc}{devlog}}{}
        \twentymiditem{Compiler}{
            One of the hardest exercises in my studies was creating a working compiler that translates a simple language to simple assembler. I built it using \textbf{Rust} and a parser library, and to ensure it worked as intended, I employed \textbf{test-driven development}.}{}
    \end{twentymid}

    \section{Activities}
    
    \begin{twentymid} % Environment for a list with descriptions  
%        \twentymiditem{Databases}{
%            Databases is another course I have taken during my studies. In this course, I wrote many \textbf{SQL} queries, learned various concepts, and ultimately \textbf{designed a database} for a turn-based game.}{}
%        \twentymiditem{Parallelism}{
%            I have encountered problems that needed to be solved in parallel, such as the Dining Philosophers problem and heavy computations with metaheuristic algorithms. I implemented these solutions in \textbf{Rust}.}{}
        \twentymiditem{Patterns}{
            I have learned about \textbf{Design Patterns} not only during my studies but also from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software." This knowledge has helped me with many tasks I have encountered. For example I and my friends used \textbf{Singleton} and \textbf{Composite} to make games during gamejams.}{}
        \twentymiditem{Practice}{
            In my free time, I enjoy doing coding exercises in \textbf{C++} and \textbf{Rust} on websites like SPOJ and Exercism. Additionally, I have \textbf{mentored several people}, helping them improve their solutions and introducing them to core concepts in these languages.\colorhrefcustom{https://exercism.org/profiles/Antlion931/testimonials}{Testimonials of students}}{}
        \twentymiditem{Reports}{
            Throughout my studies, many courses required me to write reports, which I composed using \textbf{LaTeX}. This experience allowed me to develop skills and knowledge in creating professional documents.}{}
    \end{twentymid}

    \section{Hobbies}
    
    \begin{twentymid} % Environment for a list with descriptions  
        \twentymiditem{Games}{
            I love board games, one of me favorites is Magic the gathering. I have currently more then 300 cards, that I use to arrange tournaments for my friends.}{}
        \twentymiditem{Books}{
            My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson, who writes fantasy books that focus on world building and coherent magic system.}{}
